# Ok, So,
I ain't responsible for however you use my creation. This is merely for educational purposes only.

# Guide:
1. make sure you have modules installed.
2. use
  ```powershell
pip install [modulename]
```
on the missing module. (You can tell if the module has a yellow underline below it.
3. then, after all that aside, do
```powershell
python -m PyInstaller --clean --onefile stealer.py
```
4. wait for it
5. you're good to go if you see an exe file inside the 'dist' folder.
